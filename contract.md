####Roles:

* Taskmaster - keep track of tasks and manage task board; facilitate tasks and help resolve any blocks.
 
* Gitmaster - Git commits must follow semantic git protocol.
 
* Testmaster - make sure tests are being written. These should be written prior to the code, and also that the tests pass after the code is written.


####Daily process:

* Daily standup 10:35-10:45, let by yesterday's taskmaster - Each team member reports on what was done yesterday, blocks and task for today. - Bring up any immediate design concerns.

* Roles will be rotated every Wednesday and Monday.

* Meet at 12:00 if either pair wants to do so to review a task/block.

* 2nd standup at 2:30 (but no reassignment of roles). - Each role reports on status of their accountability (taskboard/test/git).

* Meet at 4:30 if either pair wants to do so to review a task/block.

* Make commits to Github by ~5:45pm

####Team expectations

* What to do when there is a disagreement about an approach/technology? - Discuss pros and cons of each approach. - Come to consensus as a group on how to proceed. - If no consensus can be reached, get a help ticket (ask fellow or instructor)

* Each team member has the right to deny a task in the interest of their physical or mental health.

* Tests must be written be the people planning to work on that area of the codebase.

* What to do if a member is frustrated? The individual should say he is frustrated, avoiding placing blame but rather looking for a way to avoid the frustration. (Use “I” rather than “you”) Don’t take things personally or make things personal. If it seems someone is not “pulling their weight”: -Task is not completed on time: - Taskmaster responsible for checking in with individual/pair and finding reason and possible solutions for delay. -If this happens in a pair: - Consider swapping roles - If it seems to come from a lack of proficiency, either stronger partner can be an “educator”; if it is struggle for both, then they can study docs, etc. together. -If one partner seems unengaged, follow up during next meeting. Or consider taking a short break.

* What does group do when merging work together? Code must be reviewed by the reviewer before approving a pull-request.

* How to pair? Individuals decide on initial driver/navigator roles. Swap roles when -a unit of code/feature is completed -it seems it will be more efficient -necessary to ensure each member performs both roles during session.

* Work after hours? Get approval from team members before working independently after hours (be clear about what code you are working on, what files you are working on) Stay after hours/work on weekends only if whole group is in agreement (even if all members cannot attend).
